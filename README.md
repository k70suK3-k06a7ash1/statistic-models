## Overview

`statistic-models` is a TypeScript library that provides implementations of various statistical models, including exponential smoothing, moving average, and state-space models. This library is designed to be modular, easy to use, and well-tested.

## Installation

```bash
npm install statistic-models
```

## 1. Double Exponential Smoothing (Additive)
The double exponential smoothing (additive) model is used for forecasting time series data with trend.



## 2. Double Exponential Smoothing (Multiplicative)
The double exponential smoothing (multiplicative) model is used for forecasting time series data with trend and multiplicative seasonality.



## 3. Exponential Smoothing
The exponential smoothing model is used for forecasting time series data without trend or seasonality.




## 4. Moving Average
The moving average model is used for smoothing time series data and identifying trends.




## 5. State Space Model
The state-space model provides a flexible framework for analyzing time series data by representing the system's state over time.





## 6. Triple Exponential Smoothing
The triple exponential smoothing model is used for forecasting time series data with trend and seasonality.




## 7. Vector Autoregression
The vector autoregression (VAR) model is used for forecasting multiple time series variables that influence each other.
